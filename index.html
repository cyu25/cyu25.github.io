                        by controlling a player with the spacebar. The objective is to navigate through

                        the gameplay. This project was created using Python.

                    <p>
                        Implemented with VHDL Code, the Basys3 FPGA board was used to generate Morse code signals by lighting a LED 
                        and producing sounds. A user will type letters/numbers into a keyboard, and the characters will take the form of 8-bit ASCII characters to be sent out
                        as Morse Code signals. In the appendix, the source code is demonstrated.

                        A full control system for a marble maze was designed using C. The maze was designed with 
                        the functionality of stepper motors, ensuring that the maze responded smoothly to the joystick movements.
                        Additionally, the code controlled the game with start/stops states from photo sensors, game timer countdown, winning and losing results, 
                        and respective LED and Seven Segment displays.

                        This game uses a stack-based solver to implement a search algorithm. The objective of
                        Sudoku is to complete a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1-9, without repeating each number in a
                        column, row, and their local 3x3 squares. The game was created using Java.
